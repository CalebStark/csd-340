            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p class="intro">
                As a child I grew up being homeschooled by my mother. I was not alone though I have two
                sisters and one brother who was also homeschooled with me. My mom did all my schooling 
                up until I was fifteen when I then began to start doing school online thru a homeschool coop.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I began online school things changed classes became easier as all I had to do was complete
                the assignment read the chapter and in most cases that came easily to me. When my mother was the 
                one leading the assignment I found that often I would not understand what she was trying to teach
                cause she was attempting to use her own personal thoughts to teach instead of following a curriculum
                to the letter. With the online classes I found myself often completing assignments early allowing 
                me to do other things that intrusted me more such as playing video games and learning about computers.

            <p>
                My parents were not fans with how much gaming I would do at times but they put up with it and let 
                me game as long my other work got done and my grades remained high. This being my motivation not only 
                did I maintain a high grade I made sure that I got as much school done as soon as I could at all times 
                I would work ahead and get assignments done early and even have semesters of homework just waiting to 
                be submitted so I could ensure once I started gaming I could continue gaming. Well not only did this 
                strategies work but I was even able to maintain a 4.0 GPA the entire time.
            </p>
            <p>
                After highschool I went to a community college as it was one of the places I could go and with how broke 
                my parents were would not cost very much allowing me a college education without all the dept. This could
                have been avoided of course if only I had spend less time gaming and more time doing extracurricular and 
                doing more advance classes setting myself up for different scholarships. I did end up getting some scholarships 
                but not enough to go to a full college. <span class="sentence">At this community college I studied cyber security and digital crime and 
                got an associates but decided to take time away from school as my second year at school was a rough year 
                leading me to want to step back and consider what I really want to do.</span>
